# Snow_Strider
This is our project for the 2022-2023 BCI Hackathon. Our project is a platformer, where your character is santa and you are trying to collect all the presents that you dropped
and get back to your sleigh with them. 


# How to run
To run this project, first make sure you have Python and pip installed and set up on your computer. Then, download this github repo as a zip file, extract and open in your IDE/code editor of choice (VS Code and Pycharm should definitely work). Then, install all the modules by typing in "pip install -r requirements.txt" into the terminal. After that, restart your IDE/code editor and then type "python main.py" into the terminal to run the game.
